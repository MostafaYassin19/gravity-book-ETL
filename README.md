 a Data Warehouse ETL project that utilizes SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) 🛠️
 . Through this project, we have been able to create, shape and elevate the data for Gravity Books
 , enabling us to make more informed strategic decisions and provide better customer experiences.

To ensure that our data is organized and ready for Gravity Books' multifaceted world
, we have designed a meticulously crafted Data Warehouse using the Snowflake Schema ❄️.
With the help of SSIS, we have captured the essence of time by meticulously recording every customer interaction and sale in the Transaction Fact Table
, dancing through Slowly Changing Dimensions 🕰️ to shape Gravity Books' story.

Another masterpiece of this project is the Accumulated Snapshot Fact Table 📈
, which freezes pivotal moments to provide a panoramic view of crucial business metrics. To ensure the accuracy and harmony of data relationships, we have utilized SSIS's Lookup features 🔍.

This project is not just about data, it's an odyssey of innovation 🚀. We invite you to embark on the Gravity Books Data Odyssey with us and see the impact of this project firsthand.
